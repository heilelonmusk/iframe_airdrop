## 🚀 **Project Goals & Architecture**

### 🔹 **Main Objectives**
- Provide a **serverless AI chatbot** for user queries.
- Store **knowledge base** in MongoDB to reduce API dependency.
- Fetch **real-time data** via API and RSS integrations.
- Ensure **secure & optimized** responses with **rate limiting**.

### 🔹 **Core Components**
| Module                           | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `server.js`                      | Handles API requests, chatbot logic, and database queries. |
| `transformer.js`                  | Manages AI responses using GPT-3.5 fallback. |
| `intentRecognizer.js`             | Determines user intent for relevant responses. |
| `knowledge.json`                  | Stores predefined answers to reduce API calls. |
| `learningModule.js`               | Handles knowledge expansion via API/RSS feeds. |
| `ultronChat.js`                   | Manages frontend interactions with Ultron AI. |
| `seedKnowledge.js`                | Populates MongoDB with initial AI knowledge. |
